# Laggards (16% of market)

## Profile

**"Traditionalists"**

Laggards are the last segment to adopt products, if they adopt at all. They are highly resistant to change, deeply skeptical of marketing claims, and prefer time-tested, traditional solutions. Many continue using the same products they've used for decades.

## Characteristics

### Psychological Profile
- **Change-resistant**: Actively avoid new products and changes
- **Highly skeptical**: Distrust marketing and new claims
- **Traditional**: Value what has worked historically
- **Isolated**: Make decisions independently, not influenced by trends
- **Economical**: Extremely price-conscious, waste-avoidant

### Purchase Behavior
- **Minimal purchasing**: Buy only when necessary
- **Routine-bound**: Repeat same purchases for years/decades
- **Price-fixated**: Seek absolute lowest price
- **Brand inertia**: Use same brands from childhood/young adulthood
- **Reluctant buyers**: View shopping as necessary chore, not pleasure

### Communication Preferences
- **Ignore marketing**: Actively avoid advertising and promotions
- **Word-of-mouth**: Only trust long-standing personal relationships
- **Simplicity required**: Any complexity creates rejection
- **Stability valued**: Any change is viewed negatively
- **Traditional sources**: Trust family, tradition, and long experience

## Skincare Market Application

### Product Characteristics
- **Minimal formulations**: Basic, simple, traditional ingredients
- **Multi-generational use**: Products used for 20+ years
- **Extreme simplicity**: Single-purpose, straightforward products
- **Rock-bottom pricing**: Absolute lowest price points
- **No frills**: Basic packaging, no premium positioning

### Example Products
- Plain bar soap (Sunlight, Lifebuoy)
- Basic petroleum jelly (generic or Vaseline)
- Simple cold cream
- Basic glycerin
- Plain aqueous cream
- Traditional home remedies
- Soap and water (no special products)

### Distribution Channels
- **Convenience stores**: Local corner shops
- **Discount retailers**: Lowest-price vendors
- **General dealers**: Rural trading stores
- **Informal markets**: Local vendors and markets
- **Traditional sources**: Family provision, bulk buying

### Market Segments
- **Product Type**: Basic cleansers (soap), basic moisturizers only
- **Category**: Lowest-tier mass market, generics
- **End User**: All demographics, often older consumers or very price-constrained
- **Ingredient Type**: Conventional, traditional formulations only
- **Geographic**: All areas, especially rural and lower-income communities

## Strategic Importance

### Market Characteristics
- **16% of total market**: Smallest adoption segment but not negligible
- **Low value per customer**: Minimal spending, infrequent purchases
- **High loyalty**: Once adopted, extremely stable customers
- **Efficiency required**: Only viable through ultra-low-cost operations

### Business Considerations
- Often not worth targeting directly
- Reached as overflow from late majority strategies
- Can be served by generic/store brands
- May represent decline phase for aging products

## Reaching Laggards

### Natural Evolution
Laggards are typically not "reached" through marketing but rather:
- Adopt when no other options exist
- Forced by product discontinuation
- Convenience (new product becomes only available option)
- Price (cheaper than their traditional choice)

### Characteristics That Work

**Extreme Simplicity**
- Minimal product variety
- Clear, basic function
- No options or variants
- Simple packaging

**Absolute Value**
- Lowest price in category
- Bulk purchasing options
- No-frills everything
- Functional over aesthetic

**Proven Longevity**
- Products with 20+ year history
- Multi-generational use
- Traditional brand heritage
- "Old-fashioned" positioning

**Forced Adoption**
- Old product no longer available
- Recommended by doctor for medical reason
- Given as gift and works well
- Only option in accessible location

## Marketing Considerations

### Effective Approaches
- ✓ Virtually no marketing (it's wasted)
- ✓ Low-cost packaging and presentation
- ✓ Heritage and tradition messaging
- ✓ Family legacy positioning
- ✓ Extreme value emphasis

### Why Marketing Fails
- Laggards ignore advertising
- Skeptical of all claims
- Make decisions independent of messages
- Consider marketing a "con"
- Rely only on personal experience

### Key Channels (minimal investment)
- Point-of-sale presence only
- Shelf availability
- Word-of-mouth (organic only)
- Generational hand-down
- Medical necessity recommendations

## Product Strategy

### Minimalist Approach
- Absolute basics only
- No innovation
- Unchanged formulation for decades
- Simple, functional packaging
- Lowest cost production

### Value Optimization
- Bulk sizes for lowest unit price
- Generic or store brand positioning
- Minimal packaging costs
- Efficient distribution
- No promotional spending

### Stability
- Never change formulation
- Consistent packaging (changes confuse and alienate)
- Predictable availability
- Stable pricing

## Challenges

### Economic Unviability
- Extremely low margins
- High cost to serve relative to revenue
- Limited growth potential
- Price-only competition

### Resistance to Improvement
- Cannot innovate without losing customers
- Product improvements viewed as negative
- Even positive changes create rejection
- Stuck with outdated formulations

### Market Decline
- Segment shrinks as generational change occurs
- Younger consumers start elsewhere in lifecycle
- Natural attrition not replaced
- Represents end-of-lifecycle products

### No Marketing ROI
- Advertising ignored or counterproductive
- Promotions ineffective
- Brand building wasted
- Only viable through minimal-cost approach

## Key Metrics

- **Time to adoption**: Many years or never
- **Price sensitivity**: Extreme - price is only decision factor
- **Repeat purchase**: Very high if adopted (inertia)
- **Word-of-mouth**: None or negative influence
- **Market share**: Can be stable but non-growing

## "Success" Indicators

## Role in Market Dynamics

### Market Floor
- Represents baseline price and quality expectations
- Sets minimum standard for category
- Provides benchmark for value positioning

### Generational Bridge
- Some laggard products span generations
- Can become retro/heritage for new adopters
- Potential for repositioning (rare)

### End of Lifecycle
- Often represents dying product categories
- Indicates where market is moving away from
- Signals need for innovation in category

## Examples in Skincare Market

### Classic Laggard Products
- Sunlight soap bars
- Generic petroleum jelly
- Basic aqueous cream (hospital formulary)
- Traditional cold cream
- Plain glycerin
- Home-made remedies (not commercial products)

### Why They Persist
- Generational use patterns
- Extreme low cost
- Perceived as "good enough"
- Distrust of modern alternatives
- Economic constraints
- Traditional values

## Transition Dynamics

### From Late Majority
Gradual slide from late majority into laggards:
- Increasing price sensitivity
- Decreasing openness to any change
- Strengthening skepticism
- Growing isolation from mainstream trends

### Generational Pattern
- Older consumers over-represented
- Young consumers rarely start here
- Lifecycle stage correlation
- Cultural and economic factors

## Critical Realities

### Limited Business Potential
1. **Minimal revenue per customer** - lowest spending segment
2. **No growth potential** - market is static or declining
3. **Highest cost to serve** - need lowest prices with broad distribution
4. **No innovation opportunity** - any change creates rejection
5. **Marketing waste** - advertising ROI is negative
6. **Efficiency required** - only viable through ultra-lean operations

### Strategic Options

**Harvest**
- Maintain product for loyal base
- Minimize all costs
- Extract remaining value
- Plan for eventual sunset

**Abandon**
- Exit segment entirely
- Focus resources on growth segments
- Discontinue unprofitable products
- Manage customer transition

**Niche Sustain**
- Serve through efficient generics
- Store brand positioning
- Minimal-viable presence
- Cost-leadership focus

## Market Insights

### Not a Target
Laggards should rarely be a strategic target:
- Cannot build a business on this segment alone
- Better to over-serve and capture as overflow
- Focus on earlier adopter segments
- Let generics and store brands serve this segment

### Natural Market Completion
Represents the final stage of product adoption:
- Product has reached everyone who will ever adopt
- Market is mature and often declining
- Innovation has moved to new categories
- Traditional products in maintenance mode

### Generational Change
As older laggards age out:
- Segment shrinks
- Products fade
- New generation starts at early majority
- Market composition shifts younger

## Conclusion

Laggards represent the end of the adoption curve - those who resist change and maintain traditional approaches. While they represent 16% of the market, they are typically not a strategic focus but rather a natural consequence of broad market penetration. Success with laggards is measured not by growth but by efficient service of a declining but loyal customer base.

The skincare market's laggard segment is characterized by traditional soap, petroleum jelly, and basic formulations that have existed unchanged for decades, serving price-sensitive customers who value simplicity and tradition over innovation.
