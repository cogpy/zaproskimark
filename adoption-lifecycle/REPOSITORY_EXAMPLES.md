# Repository Dynamics: Live Examples

This document demonstrates how the existing South African skincare market segments in this repository map to the Technology Adoption Lifecycle, providing concrete examples from the market structure.

## Overview

The repository contains market segmentation across five dimensions:
1. Product Type (Facial Care, Body Care, Lip Care)
2. Category (Mass, Luxury/Premium)
3. End User (Men, Women, Kids/Children)
4. Ingredient Type (Conventional, Natural/Organic)
